Game Name: FOOTBALL BINGO

Description: This is a football based grid game. The aim is to select a box that matches either the current club, country or position of the randomly generated player. A correct selection will highlight the box green and an incorrect selection will highlight it red. If you successfully highlight all the boxes green, you win the game and get 'BINGO'. If you are unsuccessful, you will recieve a score that you can try and beat. This is a game I have previously played with friends and enjoyed.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Next Steps: To further enhance this game I can grow the database of players to make it more unique each time it is played. Additionally, I could add a scoreboard which saves each score as a reminder to the player.
